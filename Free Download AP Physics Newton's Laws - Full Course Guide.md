*   **Newton's Second Law (F = ma):** Applying the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration to solve problems. This includes free-body diagrams, which are essential tools for analyzing forces.
*   **Newton's Third Law (Action-Reaction):** Identifying action-reaction pairs and understanding how they interact.
*   **Applications of Newton's Laws:** Exploring real-world examples and scenarios where Newton's Laws are applied, such as inclined planes, friction, and circular motion.
*   **Problem-Solving Strategies:** Developing effective problem-solving techniques that can be applied to a wide range of physics problems.
*   **Practice Quizzes and Exercises:** Reinforcing your understanding through interactive quizzes and problem sets.

The specific modules may include:

*   **Introduction to Forces:** Defining different types of forces (gravity, tension, friction, normal force) and their properties.
*   **Free-Body Diagrams:** Learning how to draw and interpret free-body diagrams to analyze forces acting on an object.
*   **Solving Problems with Newton's Second Law:** Applying F = ma to solve problems involving linear motion, inclined planes, and other scenarios.
*   **Friction:** Understanding static and kinetic friction and their effects on motion.
*   **Circular Motion:** Analyzing the forces involved in circular motion, including centripetal force and centripetal acceleration.
*   **Work and Energy (Sometimes Included as an Extension):** How work and energy relate to force and motion.
