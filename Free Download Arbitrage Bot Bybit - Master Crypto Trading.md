## Understanding Arbitrage and Bybit

Before diving into the specifics of an arbitrage bot, it's essential to grasp the underlying concepts. **Arbitrage** is the practice of simultaneously buying and selling an asset in different markets to profit from a temporary difference in price. Bybit, a popular cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, offers a fertile ground for arbitrage opportunities due to its diverse trading pairs and leverage options.

## What is an Arbitrage Bot?

An **arbitrage bot** is an automated software program designed to detect and execute arbitrage trades. These bots continuously monitor multiple exchanges for price discrepancies, and when an opportunity arises, they automatically buy the asset on the cheaper exchange and sell it on the more expensive exchange. This entire process happens within seconds, maximizing the chances of a successful trade.
