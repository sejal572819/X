## Example Apex Interview Questions and Answers

To give you a sneak peek into the content you'll find in the download, here are a couple of example questions and answers:

**Question:** What are Apex Governor Limits, and why are they important?

**Answer:** Apex Governor Limits are runtime limits enforced by the Salesforce platform to ensure that multi-tenant environments remain stable and performant. They restrict the amount of resources that Apex code can consume, such as CPU time, SOQL queries, and DML statements. They are important because they prevent runaway code from monopolizing system resources and affecting other users on the platform.

**Question:** How would you handle exceptions in Apex?

**Answer:** In Apex, I would handle exceptions using `try-catch` blocks. The `try` block contains the code that might throw an exception, and the `catch` block contains the code that handles the exception. It's best practice to catch specific exceptions (like `DmlException` or `QueryException`) rather than a generic `Exception` to provide more targeted error handling. Additionally, I would log exceptions using custom error logs or platform events to facilitate debugging and monitoring.
