*   **Module 3: Configuring ArgoCD for Google SSO.** Discover the process of configuring ArgoCD to authenticate against Google using OAuth 2.0. This involves:
    *   Modifying the ArgoCD configuration file (`argocd-cm.yaml`).
    *   Adding the necessary OAuth 2.0 configuration.
    *   Configuring the redirect URI.
    *   Restarting the ArgoCD server.
*   **Module 4: Testing and Troubleshooting.** Learn how to test the SSO integration and troubleshoot common issues. This includes:
    *   Verifying the OAuth flow.
    *   Debugging authentication errors.
    *   Checking ArgoCD logs.
*   **Module 5: Advanced Configuration (Optional).** Explore advanced configuration options, such as:
    *   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) integration with Google Groups.
    *   Customizing the login page.
    *   Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA).
*   **Module 6: Securing ArgoCD Access.** Discuss best practices for securing ArgoCD access, including:
    *   Limiting access to the ArgoCD server.
    *   Enabling TLS encryption.
    *   Regularly auditing access logs.
*   **Module 7: Automating ArgoCD Installation with Google Cloud.** Use tools like Terraform and Cloud Deployment Manager to provision ArgoCD instances, integrated with Google SSO, automatically.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the course, you should have:

*   A basic understanding of ArgoCD and GitOps concepts.
*   A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account with appropriate permissions.
*   Familiarity with command-line tools and YAML configuration.
*   Access to a Kubernetes cluster where ArgoCD is installed. (Minikube is sufficient for testing)

## Step-by-Step Guide: Implementing ArgoCD SSO with Google

Here's a simplified overview of the steps involved in implementing ArgoCD SSO with Google, which are covered in detail in the free course:

1.  **Create a Google Cloud Project:** If you don't already have one, create a new Google Cloud project.
2.  **Configure the OAuth Consent Screen:** Configure the OAuth consent screen in the Google Cloud Console. Provide the necessary information about your application, including the application name, support email, and authorized domains.
3.  **Create OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials:** Create OAuth 2.0 client credentials in the Google Cloud Console. Choose "Web application" as the application type.  Note down the Client ID and Client Secret.
4.  **Configure ArgoCD:** Edit the `argocd-cm.yaml` ConfigMap to configure ArgoCD to use Google for authentication.  This involves providing the Client ID, Client Secret, and redirect URI. The redirect URI should be set to the ArgoCD callback URL (e.g., `https://argocd.example.com/auth/callback`).
5.  **Restart ArgoCD:** Restart the ArgoCD server to apply the changes.
6.  **Test the Integration:** Access the ArgoCD UI and attempt to log in with your Google account. You should be redirected to Google for authentication and then back to ArgoCD with your authenticated user.
7.  **Configure RBAC (Optional):** Integrate ArgoCD with Google Groups to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This allows you to grant different levels of access to ArgoCD resources based on Google Group membership.

*   **Incorrect Redirect URI:** Ensure that the redirect URI is correctly configured in both the Google Cloud Console and the ArgoCD configuration file.
*   **Authentication Errors:** Check the ArgoCD logs for any authentication errors. The logs may provide valuable information about the cause of the error.
*   **Permission Issues:** Ensure that the Google account you are using has the necessary permissions to access ArgoCD resources.

## Beyond SSO: Securing Your ArgoCD Instance

While implementing SSO with Google is an important step in securing your ArgoCD instance, it's not the only step. Here are some additional security measures you should consider:

*   **Enable TLS Encryption:** Enable TLS encryption to protect the communication between the ArgoCD server and the client.
*   **Limit Access to the ArgoCD Server:** Restrict access to the ArgoCD server to only authorized users and networks.
*   **Regularly Audit Access Logs:** Regularly audit the ArgoCD access logs to identify any suspicious activity.
*   **Implement Network Policies:** Use Kubernetes network policies to restrict network traffic to and from the ArgoCD pods.
*   **Keep ArgoCD Up-to-Date:** Keep ArgoCD up-to-date with the latest security patches.
