*   **Cryptocurrency Arbitrage**: A cryptocurrency is trading at \$10,000 on one exchange and \$10,100 on another exchange. An arbitrageur can buy the cryptocurrency on the first exchange and sell it on the second exchange, pocketing the \$100 difference (minus transaction fees).
*   **Triangular Currency Arbitrage**: A currency trader notices that the exchange rates between EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and EUR/GBP are misaligned. The trader can exploit this misalignment by executing a series of trades involving these three currencies, generating a risk-free profit.
*   **Commodity Arbitrage**: A commodity trader notices that the price of gold is higher in London than in New York. The trader can buy gold in New York and sell it in London, profiting from the price difference.

These are just a few examples of the many arbitrage opportunities that exist in various markets. With the right knowledge, skills, and tools, you can learn to identify and exploit these opportunities to generate consistent profits.
