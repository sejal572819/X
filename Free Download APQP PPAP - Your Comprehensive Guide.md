## What is APQP (Advanced Product Quality Planning)?

**Advanced Product Quality Planning (APQP)** is a structured process aimed at ensuring customer satisfaction with new products or services. It's a framework for product quality planning, defining the steps necessary to assure a product meets the customer's requirements. It's not just about the final product; it encompasses the entire process from concept to launch.

**The Five Phases of APQP:**

1.  **Plan and Define Program:** This phase involves understanding customer needs, defining product requirements, and establishing goals for the project. Key outputs include the design goals, reliability goals, and preliminary bill of material.
2.  **Product Design and Development Verification:** This phase focuses on designing the product and verifying that the design meets the requirements. This includes creating prototypes, conducting design reviews, and performing testing. Key outputs include design failure mode and effects analysis (DFMEA) and design for manufacturability (DFM) analysis.
3.  **Process Design and Development Verification:** This phase focuses on designing the manufacturing process and verifying that it can produce the product to the required quality standards. Key outputs include process flow diagrams, process failure mode and effects analysis (PFMEA), and control plans.
4.  **Product and Process Validation:** This phase involves validating that the product and process meet the customer's requirements. This includes conducting trial runs, performing capability studies, and obtaining customer approval. Key outputs include initial sample inspection reports (ISIR) and process capability studies.
5.  **Feedback, Assessment, and Corrective Action:** This phase focuses on monitoring the product and process after launch and taking corrective action to address any issues. This includes collecting customer feedback, analyzing data, and implementing continuous improvement measures.

**Key Tools and Techniques used in APQP:**

*   **Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA):** A systematic method for identifying potential failure modes in a product or process and assessing their impact.
*   **Design of Experiments (DOE):** A statistical technique for optimizing product and process parameters.
*   **Statistical Process Control (SPC):** A method for monitoring and controlling process variation.
*   **Control Plans:** Documents that outline the methods used to control the manufacturing process.

## What is PPAP (Production Part Approval Process)?

**Production Part Approval Process (PPAP)** is a standardized process in the automotive and manufacturing industries used to ensure that suppliers can consistently produce parts that meet the customer's requirements. It’s a collection of documents that demonstrate that the supplier understands the customer's specifications and that the manufacturing process is capable of producing parts that meet those specifications.

**The Elements of a PPAP Submission:**

A PPAP submission typically includes the following documents and information:

1.  **Design Records:** Copies of all customer-approved engineering drawings and specifications.
2.  **Engineering Change Documents:** Documentation of any changes made to the design since the initial approval.
3.  **Customer Engineering Approval:** Evidence that the customer has approved the design and any changes.
4.  **Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (DFMEA):** An analysis of potential failure modes in the product design.
5.  **Process Flow Diagram:** A visual representation of the manufacturing process.
6.  **Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (PFMEA):** An analysis of potential failure modes in the manufacturing process.
7.  **Control Plan:** A document outlining the methods used to control the manufacturing process.
8.  **Measurement System Analysis (MSA):** Studies to ensure that the measurement systems used to monitor the manufacturing process are accurate and reliable.
9.  **Dimensional Results:** Measurements of key product dimensions to verify that they meet the specifications.
10. **Material Test Results:** Results of tests performed on the materials used to manufacture the product.
11. **Performance Test Results:** Results of tests performed to verify that the product meets the performance requirements.
12. **Initial Sample Inspection Report (ISIR):** A report summarizing the results of the initial inspection of the production parts.
13. **Process Capability Studies:** Studies to demonstrate that the manufacturing process is capable of producing parts that meet the specifications.
14. **Qualified Laboratory Documentation:** Documentation verifying that any laboratory used for testing is qualified to perform the tests.
15. **Appearance Approval Report (AAR):** A report verifying that the appearance of the product meets the customer's requirements (if applicable).
16. **Sample Production Parts:** Actual production parts submitted to the customer for approval.

**PPAP Submission Levels:**

There are five levels of PPAP submission, ranging from Level 1 (limited submission) to Level 5 (full submission). The level of submission required depends on the customer's requirements and the complexity of the part.
