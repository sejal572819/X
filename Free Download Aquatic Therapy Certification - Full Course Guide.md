## Why Get Certified in Aquatic Therapy?

Aquatic therapy is a specialized form of physical therapy conducted in a pool or other aquatic environment. It offers numerous benefits over traditional land-based therapy, making it a valuable skill for physical therapists, occupational therapists, athletic trainers, and other healthcare professionals.

*   **Increased Range of Motion:** Water provides support and resistance, facilitating greater range of motion and flexibility.
*   **Muscle Relaxation:** Warm water promotes muscle relaxation, reducing pain and spasms.
*   **Improved Circulation:** Hydrostatic pressure improves circulation and reduces edema.
