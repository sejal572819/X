## Course Curriculum: What You'll Learn

This comprehensive arrhythmia class is structured to provide a clear and concise understanding of heart rhythms. Here's a breakdown of the key modules:

**Module 1: Introduction to Electrocardiography (ECG)**

*   **What is an ECG?** A brief overview of the purpose and function of electrocardiograms.
*   **Anatomy and Physiology of the Heart:** A review of the heart's electrical conduction system.
*   **Understanding the ECG Paper:** Learn to measure time and voltage on an ECG tracing.
*   **Key ECG Components:** P wave, QRS complex, T wave, and their significance.

**Module 2: Normal Sinus Rhythm**

*   **Defining Normal Sinus Rhythm:** Characteristics and criteria for a healthy heart rhythm.
*   **Heart Rate Calculation:** Learn different methods for calculating heart rate from an ECG.
*   **Sinus Arrhythmia:** Understanding variations in heart rate related to respiration.
*   **Clinical Significance:** Recognize the importance of normal sinus rhythm as a baseline.

**Module 3: Atrial Arrhythmias**

*   **Atrial Fibrillation (AFib):** Identifying irregular R-R intervals and absent P waves. Understanding the risk of stroke and treatment options.
*   **Atrial Flutter:** Recognizing the characteristic "sawtooth" pattern.
*   **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT):** Identifying rapid heart rates originating above the ventricles.
*   **Premature Atrial Contractions (PACs):** Recognizing early beats originating in the atria.

**Module 4: Ventricular Arrhythmias**

*   **Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs):** Understanding the morphology of PVCs and their frequency.
*   **Ventricular Tachycardia (V-Tach):** Identifying wide QRS complexes and rapid heart rates. Understanding the potential for V-Tach to degenerate into V-Fib.
*   **Ventricular Fibrillation (V-Fib):** Recognizing chaotic, irregular waveforms and the need for immediate defibrillation.
*   **Idioventricular Rhythm:** Understanding the significance of a slow ventricular rhythm.

**Module 5: Heart Blocks (AV Blocks)**

*   **First-Degree AV Block:** Understanding the prolonged PR interval.
*   **Second-Degree AV Block (Mobitz Type I & II):** Differentiating between Wenckebach and Mobitz Type II blocks.
*   **Third-Degree AV Block (Complete Heart Block):** Recognizing the complete dissociation between P waves and QRS complexes.

**Module 6: Other Arrhythmias and ECG Abnormalities**

*   **Bundle Branch Blocks (BBB):** Identifying left and right bundle branch blocks.
*   **Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome:** Recognizing the delta wave and short PR interval.
*   **Electrolyte Imbalances:** Understanding the effects of potassium and calcium imbalances on the ECG.
*   **Ischemia and Infarction:** Identifying ST-segment elevation and depression, T-wave inversion, and Q waves.

**Module 7: Treatment Strategies for Arrhythmias**

*   **Medications:** Overview of common antiarrhythmic drugs.
*   **Cardioversion and Defibrillation:** Understanding the principles and techniques of electrical cardioversion and defibrillation.
*   **Pacemakers:** Understanding the different types of pacemakers and their function.
*   **Ablation:** Overview of catheter ablation for treating arrhythmias.

This course goes beyond just memorizing patterns; it emphasizes understanding the underlying mechanisms that cause arrhythmias. You'll learn to analyze ECG strips systematically, identify key features, and correlate them with clinical findings.
